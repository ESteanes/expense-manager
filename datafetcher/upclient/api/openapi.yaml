    The Up API gives you programmatic access to your balances and
    transaction data. You can request past transactions or set up
    webhooks to receive real-time events when new transactions hit your
    account. It‚Äôs new, it‚Äôs exciting and it‚Äôs just the beginning.

    Accounts represent the underlying store used to track balances
    and the transactions that have occurred to modify those balances
    over time. Up currently has three types of account: `SAVER`‚Äîused to
    earn interest and to hit savings goals, `TRANSACTIONAL`‚Äîused
    for everyday spending, and `HOME_LOAN`-for those with an Up Home loan.

    Categories enable understanding where your money goes by driving
    powerful insights in Up. All categories in Up are pre-defined
    and are automatically assigned to new purchases in most cases. A
    parent-child relationship is used to represent categories,
    however parent categories cannot be directly assigned to
    transactions.
  name: Categories

    Tags are custom labels that can be associated with transactions
    on Up. Within the Up application, tags provide additional insight
    into spending. For example, you could have a "Take Away" tag that
    you apply to purchases from food delivery services. The Up API
    allows you to manage the tags associated with transactions. Each
    transaction may have up to 6 tags.

    Tags are identified by their labels, which are unique strings,
    so the tag "Holiday" has also the `id` `"Holiday"`.

    Transactions represent the movement of money into and out of an
    account. They have many characteristics that vary depending on
    the kind of transaction. Transactions may be temporarily `HELD`
    (pending) or `SETTLED`, typically depending on which payment
    method was used at the point of sale.

    Attachments represent uploaded files that are attached to transactions, these are commonly receipts.

    Some endpoints exist not to expose data, but to test the API
    itself. Currently there is only one endpoint in this group: ping!
  name: Utility endpoints

    Webhooks provide a mechanism for a configured URL to receive
    events when transaction activity occurs on Up. You can think of
    webhooks as being like push notifications for your server-side
    application.

            post:
              description: |
                Once you have created a webhook in the Up API, events are sent to the
                webhook‚Äôs configured URL as JSON-encoded `POST` requests. The webhook
                URL must respond with a HTTP `200` status on success.

                It is important that the URL responds in a timely manner. If the URL
                takes too long to respond (currently 30s), the request will be timed
                out. For this reason it is strongly advised to avoid any heavy
                processing before a response has been returned from the URL. A common
                solution to this problem is to use a message broker such as RabbitMQ
                to do the work asynchronously.

                Event delivery is retried with exponential backoff in the case of any
                non-`200` response status, if the URL is unreachable, or if the request
                is timed out.

                Refer to the `eventType` attribute in order to determine what course of
                action to take when handling the event. The following event types are
                currently sent:

                **`PING`**

                Manually triggered by calls to the webhook `ping` endpoint. Used for
                testing and debugging purposes.

                **`TRANSACTION_CREATED`**

                Triggered whenever a new transaction is created in Up. This event
                includes a `transaction` relationship that provides the unique
                identifier for the transaction and a link to the transaction within the
                Up API. This link should be used to retrieve the complete transaction
                data.

                **`TRANSACTION_SETTLED`**

                Triggered whenever a transaction transitions from the `HELD` status to
                the `SETTLED` status. This event includes a `transaction` relationship
                that provides the unique identifier for the transaction and a link to
                the transaction within the Up API. This link should be used to retrieve
                the complete transaction data.

                Due to external factors in banking processes, on rare occasions this
                event may not be triggered. Separate `TRANSACTION_DELETED` and
                `TRANSACTION_CREATED` events will be received in its place.

                **`TRANSACTION_DELETED`**

                Triggered whenever a `HELD` transaction is deleted from Up. This
                generally occurs for example when a hotel deposit is returned. This
                event includes a `transaction` relationship that provides the unique
                identifier for the transaction, however no link is provided to the
                transaction within the Up API as it no longer exists.

                ## Securing Webhook Event Handlers

                Incoming webhook event requests include a `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature`
                header, which can be used to verify that the event was sent by Up.
                Verification of the signature requires knowledge of the shared
                `secretKey` that was returned upon creation of the webhook. This key is
                known only to your application and to Up.

                The verification process involves:

                1. Taking the raw, unparsed webhook event request body.
                2. Computing the SHA-256 HMAC signature of the request body, using the
                   shared `secretKey`.
                3. Comparing the computed HMAC signature with the value of the
                   `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature` header.

                If the computed SHA-256 HMAC signature matches the
                `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature` header, the request is valid.

                A few language-specific examples follow.

                **Ruby**:

                This example uses the Ruby on Rails framework.

                ```ruby
                require 'openssl'

                def handle_webhook_event
                  received_signature =
                    request.headers['X-Up-Authenticity-Signature']

                  signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(
                    'SHA256',
                    secret_key,
                    request.raw_post,
                  )

                  if Rack::Utils.secure_compare(received_signature, signature)
                    # Process webhook event
                  end
                end
                ```

                **PHP**:

                This example uses the Laravel framework.

                ```php
                public function handleWebhookEvent(Request $request) {
                    $received_signature = $request->header(
                        'X-Up-Authenticity-Signature',
                        ''
                    );
                    $raw_body = $request->getContent();
                    $signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $raw_body, $this->secretKey);

                    if (hash_equals($signature, $received_signature)) {
                        // Process webhook event
                    }
                }
                ```

                **Go**:

                This example is in plain Go.

                ```go
                import (
                    "crypto/hmac"
                    "crypto/sha256"
                    "encoding/hex"
                    "io"
                    "net/http"
                )

                func handleWebhookEvent(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
                    receivedSignature, _ := hex.DecodeString(
                        r.Header.Get("X-Up-Authenticity-Signature"),
                    )

                    mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, secretKey)
                    io.Copy(mac, r.Body)
                    signature := mac.Sum(nil)

                    if hmac.Equal(signature, receivedSignature)
                        // Process webhook event
                    }
                }
                ```

                If the `secretKey` for a webhook is lost, simply create a new webhook
                with the same URL, capture the returned `secretKey` and delete the
                original webhook.

      description: |
        Create a new webhook with a given URL. The URL will receive webhook
        events as JSON-encoded `POST` requests. The URL must respond with a HTTP
        `200` status on success.

        There is currently a limit of 10 webhooks at any given time. Once this
        limit is reached, existing webhooks will need to be deleted before new
        webhooks can be created.

        Event delivery is retried with exponential backoff if the URL is
        unreachable or it does not respond with a `200` status. The response
        includes a `secretKey` attribute, which is used to sign requests sent to
        the webhook URL. It will not be returned from any other endpoints within
        the Up API. If the `secretKey` is lost, simply create a new webhook with
        the same URL, capture its `secretKey` and then delete the original
        webhook. See [Handling webhook events](#callback_post_webhookURL) for
        details on how to process webhook events.

        It is probably a good idea to test the webhook by
        [sending it a `PING` event](#post_webhooks_webhookId_ping) after creating
        it.
